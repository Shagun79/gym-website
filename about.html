     <p> <h1>  OUR STORY    </h1>
       
Gym and Fitness was founded in 2002 <br> as a family owned and operated business specialising in supplying high-quality <br>  
gym equipment at great prices.

Instead of being just another gym equipment <br> retailer, our founders wanted to be the best <br> in the industry and set their minds to doing so! Over <br> the last two decades Gym and Fitness has <br> grown into one of Australia’s largest  <br> online fitness equipment retailers, helping thousands of customers <br> live longer, happier and healthier lives.
  <h1> OUR VALUES </h1>

For 20 years helping customers reach their  <br>
fitness goals has been at the heart of what we do <br>
and why we do it! We live and breathe our six core values and four brand promises   <br> — which speak of our commitment to our customers, staff,   <br>
the industry and our business as a whole.
